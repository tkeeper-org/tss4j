# Threshold Signature Scheme: Threat Model

---

## 1. System Overview

This document describes the threat model for three threshold cryptographic scheme implementations designed for security-critical financial infrastructure (custody, payments, distributed signing).

### 1.1 Protocol Implementations

**FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**

- RFC 9591 compliant, two-round Schnorr threshold signing.
- Ciphersuites: FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512), FROST(secp256k1, SHA-256), FROST(P-256, SHA-256).
- Trusted dealer key generation via Shamir Secret Sharing with Feldman VSS.
- Bitcoin-specific variants: BIP-340 Schnorr and BIP-341 Taproot key-path spending (secp256k1 only).
- Nonce generation hedged against bad RNG via H3(random_bytes(32) ‖ SerializeScalar(sk_i)).

**GG20 (Gennaro–Goldfeder 2020 Threshold ECDSA)**

- One-round online threshold ECDSA with identifiable abort.
- Hardened with zero-knowledge proofs from CGGMP21/24.
- Paillier-based multiplicative-to-additive (MtA) sub-protocol.
- Supported curves: secp256k1, secp256r1 (P-256).

**Threshold ECIES (Verifiable Threshold ElGamal Decryption)**

- Non-interactive ElGamal KEM encryption; threshold decryption via Lagrange interpolation.
- Each participant produces a partial decrypt `dᵢ = [skᵢ]R` with a DLEQ proof.
- Coordinator verifies all DLEQ proofs before combining; aborts with identifiable participant index on failure.
- Supported curves: secp256k1, secp256r1 (P-256).
- KDF: HKDF-SHA-384 with domain separation; symmetric layer: AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.

### 1.2 Deployment Context

- Participants are distributed across independent trust domains.
- Communication channels are authenticated and reliable (but not necessarily confidential).
- Threshold configuration: t-of-n where t ≥ 2.
- Target security level: 128-bit (secp256k1, P-256, Ed25519).

## 3. Trust Model and Assumptions

### 3.1 Adversary Model

- **Dishonest majority not tolerated.** Security holds if strictly fewer than t participants are corrupted.
- The Coordinator (FROST) or any single participant (GG20, ECIES) may be corrupted, but cannot compromise the signing or decryption key alone.
- Adversary is computationally bounded (PPT) under the Discrete Logarithm assumption (all protocols) and the composite residuosity / DDH assumptions (GG20).
- Adversary has full control over corrupted participants: can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol, send malformed messages, and collude.

### 3.2 Network Assumptions

- Authenticated channels between all participants (attacker cannot impersonate).
- Reliable delivery (attacker cannot selectively drop messages without detection).
- Confidentiality of channels is NOT required for protocol security but RECOMMENDED to prevent metadata leakage.

### 3.3 Cryptographic Assumptions

| Assumption                       | Protocol                                        | Basis                                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) | FROST, GG20, ECIES                              | secp256k1, P-256, Ed25519            |
| Random Oracle Model              | FROST (H1–H5), GG20 (Fiat-Shamir), ECIES (HKDF) | SHA-512, SHA-256, SHA-384            |
| Decisional Composite Residuosity | GG20                                            | Paillier encryption                  |
| Strong RSA                       | GG20                                            | Ring-Pedersen commitments            |
| Computational Diffie-Hellman     | GG20, ECIES                                     | MtA EC-binding proof; DLEQ soundness |

## 4. Threat Catalog

### 4.1 Key Extraction Attacks

#### T-4.1.1: Nonce Reuse (FROST)

- **Attack:** If a participant reuses a nonce pair (d_i, e_i) across two signing sessions, an attacker can algebraically recover x_i.
- **Mitigation:** Nonces generated via H3(random_bytes(32) ‖ SerializeScalar(sk_i)) per RFC 9591 §4.1. This hedges against bad RNG by mixing fresh entropy with the secret key. Nonce state is deleted immediately after sign() completes. Each nonce pair is bound to a unique operation ID.
- **Residual risk:** Negligible (2⁻¹²⁸) assuming CSPRNG provides at least 128 bits of entropy per call and no more than 2⁶⁴ signatures are produced per participant.

#### T-4.1.2: BitForge: Malicious Paillier Modulus (GG20)

- **Attack (CVE-2023-33241):** A malicious participant constructs a Paillier modulus N with small prime factors. Through repeated MtA signing sessions, the attacker extracts other participants' key shares via CRT-based recovery. Full key extraction in as few as 16 signatures.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **Paillier-Blum Modulus Proof** validates N = p·q where p ≡ q ≡ 3 (mod 4), with Jacobi symbol verification J(w, N) = −1 (addresses CVE-2025-66016).
    - **No Small Factors Proof** (CGGMP21 §C.5) proves p, q > 2²⁵⁶, parameterized with ℓ = 256 bits.
    - Both proofs verified before any MtA computation proceeds.
- **Residual risk:** Negligible under Strong RSA assumption and correct proof verification.

#### T-4.1.3: Alpha-Rays: MtA Range Proof Exploitation (GG20)

- **Attack:** Attacker selects adversarial k_i values near N in MtA, causing information leakage about peer shares through the range proof gap.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Range proof with β-parameter q² on prover side, verified against q³ bound.
    - EC-point binding in MtAwc (LAGRANGE path): respondent proves that b_j corresponds to dlog(W_j = [λ_j]Y_j) via G·s₁ = V_ec + [e]W_j in the respondent proof.
    - Paillier key size validated: N ≥ q⁸.
- **Residual risk:** Low. Full Π_{aff-g} style proof (CGGMP21) provides tighter binding; current construction provides equivalent security for the LAGRANGE path through the integrated EC check.

#### T-4.1.4: Presignature + Raw Signing Forgery (GG20)

- **Attack (CVE-2025-66017):** When presignatures (precomputed R) are combined with raw signing, an attacker who knows R can craft a substitute hash h' and transform the resulting signature into a valid signature for an arbitrary message.
- **Mitigation:** Architecture does not use presignatures. All signing sessions execute the full interactive protocol where R is computed fresh. API does not expose a presignature mode.
- **Residual risk:** None: attack vector does not exist in current architecture.

#### T-4.1.5: Invalid DLEQ Proof in Partial Decryption (ECIES)

- **Attack:** Malicious participant submits a crafted `dᵢ = [skᵢ']R` with a forged or omitted DLEQ proof, biasing the reconstructed shared secret S and either corrupting decryption or leaking information about honest shares via the Lagrange combination.
- **Mitigation:** Coordinator verifies DLEQ proof for every partial decrypt before combining: checks `[r]G = A₁ + [e]Yᵢ` and `[r]R = A₂ + [e]dᵢ` with a Fiat-Shamir challenge. Any failure raises `IdentifiableAbortException(idx)`. `Yᵢ` must be derived from DKG transcript, not from the incoming message.
- **Residual risk:** Negligible under DLP assumption. Dependent on correct `Yᵢ` sourcing: see operational recommendations.

### 4.2 Signature Forgery Attacks

#### T-4.2.1: Share Substitution in MtA (GG20)

- **Attack:** Malicious respondent in MtAwc substitutes an arbitrary value for b_j instead of their true Lagrange-weighted share w_j = λ_j · x_j. Without EC-point binding, the initiator cannot detect this substitution.
- **Mitigation:** Respondent proof includes EC commitment V_ec = [α]G. Verifier checks [s₁]G = V_ec + [e]W_j where W_j = [λ_j]Y_j is computed independently from group info established during DKG. Prover cannot satisfy this equation without knowledge of dlog(W_j).
- **Residual risk:** Negligible under CDH assumption.

#### T-4.2.2: Rogue Commitment in FROST

- **Attack:** Malicious participant crafts commitment (D_i, E_i) as a function of other participants' commitments to bias the aggregate nonce R, potentially enabling forgery.
- **Mitigation:** FROST's binding factor mechanism (RFC 9591 §4.4) computes per-participant binding factors ρ_i = H1(group_pk ‖ H4(msg) ‖ H5(commitment_list) ‖ SerializeScalar(i)). The commitment list is hashed before binding factors are derived, preventing adaptive commitment selection. Commitment list is sorted and deterministic.
- **Residual risk:** None under Random Oracle Model.

### 4.3 Denial of Service / Protocol Disruption

#### T-4.3.1: Malformed Signature Shares

- **Attack:** Corrupted participant produces invalid signature share to cause signature verification failure.
- **Mitigation:**
    - **FROST:** Coordinator verifies each signature share via verify_signature_share (RFC 9591 §5.3): [z_i]G = comm_share_i + [c·λ_i]Y_i.
    - **GG20:** Identifiable abort via delta/sigma commitment verification and Lagrange product consistency check (`assertLambdaProductMatchesDelta`).
- **Residual risk:** DoS is possible (misbehaving participant identified and excluded), but no security compromise.

#### T-4.3.2: GAMMA MtA Response Manipulation (GG20)

- **Attack:** Malicious respondent in MtA(k, γ) sends c_j = Enc(0) instead of the correctly computed ciphertext. Initiator computes incorrect α, leading to an invalid signature.
- **Mitigation:** By design per GG20: γ is ephemeral and MtA(k, γ) does not require MtAwc. Invalid response detected at signature aggregation via delta consistency check. Misbehaving participant identified through identifiable abort.
- **Residual risk:** DoS only; no key material exposure.

#### T-4.3.3: Invalid Partial Decrypt in ECIES

- **Attack:** Malicious participant submits a partial decrypt with an invalid DLEQ proof to abort decryption without revealing their key share.
- **Mitigation:** Identifiable abort: `IdentifiableAbortException` exposes the participant index. Coordinator can retry with a different quorum excluding the identified participant.
- **Residual risk:** DoS possible with any single corrupted participant in a threshold-1-of-n setup. Mitigated by quorum redundancy (n > t).

### 4.4 Side-Channel Attacks

#### T-4.4.1: Timing Leakage on Secret Operations

- **Attack:** Variable-time scalar multiplication or modular exponentiation leaks bits of secret values through timing observations.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Secret-dependent modular exponentiations use `modPowSec` (GMP `mpz_powm_sec`).
    - Secret-dependent multiplications use `multiplySec` (GMP `mpn_sec_mul`).
    - Paillier decryption and CRT operations use constant-time primitives.
    - FROST scalar serialization avoids data-dependent branching.
- **Residual risk:** Implementation-dependent. Underlying GMP library operations should be audited for constant-time guarantees on deployment platform.

#### T-4.4.2: Secret Key Memory Exposure

- **Attack:** Key shares persist in memory and are recoverable via memory dump, cold boot, or swap file analysis.
- **Mitigation:** Key shares stored in `SecretBox` with AES-256 encryption at rest. Decrypted only within `useSki()` / `useLagrangeShare()` callback scope. `BigInt` implements `Destroyable`; GMP memory cleared via `Cleaner` on GC, or immediately via `destroy()`. Memory encryption key is ephemeral per session.
- **Residual risk:** Low. JVM GC may delay memory clearing; explicit `destroy()` is recommended for all sensitive `BigInt` instances.

## 8. Limitations and Future Work

1. **GG20 UC Security:** Current implementation is proven secure in the standalone model. Migration to CGGMP24-style UC-secure protocol is planned to support safe parallel execution.
2. **Post-Quantum:** FROST, GG20, and Threshold ECIES all rely on DLP/CDH hardness. No post-quantum migration path is currently defined. NIST PQC standards (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA) do not have standardized threshold variants.
3. **Constant-Time Guarantees:** While secret-dependent operations use `*Sec` variants, a formal audit of the underlying native (GMP) library for constant-time behavior on all target platforms is recommended.
